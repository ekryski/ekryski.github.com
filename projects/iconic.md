The iConic performative skin was a project that I worked on in collaboration with Branko Kolarevic and [Matt Knapik](http://mattknapik.com), members of the faculty of environmental design and Mike Kryski, a member of the Schulich School of Engineering.  The concept was developed by Matt Knapik and is meant to be a performative facade system for a building, where each pod could be a room or a large window. The cones rotate to alter the aperture to allow for more or less light into or out of the building.  Alternatively, this sytem could be adapted for capturing rain water, providing a dynamic building facade for advertising, or simply to alter the viewpoint of occupants inside the building.

I was hired to develop the embedded software system for the iConic project, to assist with manufacturing and assembly and to provide insight into product development and rapid prototyping.
