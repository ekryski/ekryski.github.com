The X-Chair got its name from professor Charles Xavier of X-Men.  The purpose of this research project was to simulate emotion and peronality in personal vehicles.  There were two platforms, a sitting platform and a standing platform.  Both were based upon electric wheelchairs and they had an onboard pc that recieved input from Nintendo Wiimote controllers.
